# Sblogs

A full-stack social media application built using **Prisma ORM and SQL** as the backend data layer.
This was my first project working with relational databases and Prisma, and I implemented a complete set of core features including:

- User authentication and profile management
- Creating, editing and deleting posts
- Commenting on posts (one-to-many relationship)
- Liking and bookmarking posts (many-to-many relationships)
- Toggling likes / bookmarks with proper relation checks
- Clean SQL schema, represented using Prisma models

The highlight of this project is that all relationships (one-to-many and many-to-many) are handled using proper Prisma relation queries (connect, disconnect, some, etc.), which helped me build scalable and clean database logic instead of writing raw SQL manually. It was a great learning experience in modelling data the right way in Prisma and SQL.
